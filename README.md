# Hostel-Managment-System
As the name specifies “HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years, the number of educational institutions have been increasing rapidly. Thereby, the number of hostels are also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the people who are running the hostel since software’s are not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the designing of computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system with the system which is more user friendly and more CUI oriented. 

Concepts of Data Structures implemented in our projects are: 
-	Use of arrays and structures to store various data about student and employee details. 
-	Use of CSV to store information such as – Students information, Employee Information, Login details of both student and employee, Meal table. 
-	Use of File Handling to store information related to Complaints, Notice Board and Infirmary.
